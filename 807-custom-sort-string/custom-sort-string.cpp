// S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.
//
// S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
//
// Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
//
//
// Example :
// Input: 
// S = "cba"
// T = "abcd"
// Output: "cbad"
// Explanation: 
// "a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
// Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
//
//
// Â 
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
// 	T has length at most 200.
// 	S and T consist of lowercase letters only.
//
