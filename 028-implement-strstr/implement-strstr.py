# Implement strStr().
#
# Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
# Output: 2
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
# Output: -1
#
#
# Clarification:
#
# What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
#
# For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
